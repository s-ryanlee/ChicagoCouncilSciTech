Renowned scientists, Dr. Dorothy Kozlowski, Dr. Peggy Mason, and Dr. Janice Urban, will come together to discuss their groundbreaking work in neuroscience. Discussions will focus on the biology of empathy and helping behavior in rats, the incredible ability of the brain to repair itself following traumatic injury, and how the brain develops a stress response and resilience.

Join us at DePaul University for a discussion of what role the brain has in resilience, empathy, and plasticity.

A crucial part of this story is the unbelievable scientific and technological advances – traveling through hyperspace, lightsabers, holograms, the discovery of habitable planets – that fill the universe. But are these advances really beyond our reach, or have we already surpassed some of them? Are they even scientifically possible? If you want to hear the answers to these questions, join us for a lecture on the science behind Star Wars, and the physical laws that we have to “bend” to make them work.

This talk discusses the physical laws and concepts underlying the scientific advances portrayed in the Star Wars movies. It thus provides a connection between the popular ideas and visions of Star Wars and actual cutting edge science. It reviews the physics of

“The Force” in the context of the standard model of high energy physics
“Light Sabers” in the context of electromagnetism, light waves and quantum mechanics
“Faster than Light Travel” in the context of Einstein’s special theory of relativity
“Exoplanets and Intelligent Life” in the context of discovering exoplanets
“Death Star” in the context of gravitational energy

While such immunotherapies have significantly prolonged the life of some patients who had previously exhausted all treatment options, the majority of cancer patients still do not benefit from existing immunotherapies. Thus, there is an urgent need to devise new therapies that can benefit a larger population of cancer patients. A better understanding of the body’s immune system is also very important for the prevention and treatment of a growing list of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as lupus, arthritis and neurodegenerative diseases. In these diseases, the immune system misfires and attacks our own tissues. Our immune system is also crucial for defending us from infections by a large variety of microbial pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites.

Key to our understanding of the immune system is how it detects microbial pathogens and cancer cells and how it avoids attacking our own tissues in normal situations. An important mechanism of this immune detection is the detection of DNA from microbial pathogens and cancer cells. Our lab discovered the DNA sensing enzyme cGAS and the pathway through which cGAS launches immune and autoimmune responses. Dr. Chen will discuss the current status of immunotherapies and describe efforts in harnessing the cGAS pathway to fight cancer and autoimmune diseases.

If you want to hear the answers to these questions, join us for a lecture on the science behind Star Wars, and the physical laws that we have to “bend” to make them work.

After decades of growth and public acceptance, nearly all Americans now have access to some type of recycling services. But are these services providing what we expect? How much of what we put into the bins is actually recycled? Many people are still confused about recycling rules that change depending on where they live. The ripple effects of China’s recent policy changes to restrict most foreign plastic and cardboard imports have skyrocketed costs in the U.S. and caused some municipalities to close down recycling operations. Meanwhile, Chicago’s program has faced further scrutiny over its handling of the city’s privatized recycling services, highlighted in a recent Better Government Association investigation that found one private company hired by the city has a financial incentive to send recyclable materials to its own dump.

A panel discussion lead by BGA reporter Madison Hopkins and featuring Carter O’Brien, sustainability officer with The Field Museum, Michelle Thoma, president of the Chicago Recycling Coalition and general counsel for Elevate Energy, and Kuldip Kumar, an environmental scientist with the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District, will explore the future of recycling in Chicago and across the country. The discussion will emphasize ideas for large organizations, local governments, and individuals to understand and what waste management opportunities are available.
