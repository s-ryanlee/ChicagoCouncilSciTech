For thousands of years, mathematicians have used the timeless art of logic to see the world more clearly. Today, truth is buried under soundbites, spin, memes, divisive arguments and “fake news”. Seeing clearly is more important than ever. In this talk, I will show how anyone can think like a mathematician to understand what people are really telling us. Taking a careful scalpel to politics, privilege, sexism and dozens of other real-world situations, I will show that math is not just about numbers and equations, but is about thinking better, and that it can help us find clarity without losing nuance in this complex world of ours.",Video,,,"11/21/2019 04:01:01 PM"," "," ",,1,,432,384,167,129,55,36,0,0,48,31,101,66,17,38,0,0,0,432,0,167,0,55,0,0,0.9684,0.0526,0.0211,0.0211,0.0421,0,0.0211,0.0105,0.0105,0,0.0105,0.0105,0.0105,0.0105,0,0.0105,0.0105,0.0105,0.0211,0,0.0105,0.0105,0,0,0.0105,0.0105,0.0211,0.0316,0.0105,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0105,0,0,0.0105,0,0.9859,0.0141,0,0,0.0141,0,0.0141,0,0,0,0.0141,0.0141,0,0.0141,0,0,0,0.0141,0,0,0,0.0141,0,0,0,0,0.0141,0.0141,0.0141,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0141,0,0.9167,0.1667,0.0833,0.0833,0.125,0,0.0417,0.0417,0.0417,0,0,0,0.0417,0,0,0.0417,0.0417,0,0.0833,0,0.0417,0,0,0,0.0417,0.0417,0.0417,0.0833,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0417,0,0,0,0,69,,8,50,,5,1,6,2,1,6,2

DNA and fossil evidence has made it amply clear that we diverged from the apes around 7 Million years ago. Since then, the two lineages have evolved leading to humans on one hand and chimpanzees on the other. Paleoanthropologists endeavor to establish the milestone events that took place on our side of the divergence by making fossil discoveries.

When did we start to walk on two legs? Use and make stone tools? Have a human-like body proportion? Have a large brain? — These are some of the key questions. Despite major achievements, many aspects of these questions remain unanswered due to the fragmentary nature of the fossil record. Ongoing research on the earliest child found in Dikika, Ethiopia, and nicked named “Selam,” is shedding light on patterns of childhood, locomotion, dental and brain development, and many issues pertaining to human evolution. While most of our knowledge in paleoanthropology comes from remains of adult individuals like Lucy, fossil children also have unique stories to tell. Our knowledge of human evolution will be complete when we combine the two.
Key to our understanding of the immune system is how it detects microbial pathogens and cancer cells and how it avoids attacking our own tissues in normal situations. An important mechanism of this immune detection is the detection of DNA from microbial pathogens and cancer cells. Our lab discovered the DNA sensing enzyme cGAS and the pathway through which cGAS launches immune and autoimmune responses. Dr. Chen will discuss the current status of immunotherapies and describe efforts in harnessing the cGAS pathway to fight cancer and autoimmune diseases.

Dr. Leon Lederman was a Nobel prize-winning physicist with a passion for science education. He served as the director of Fermilab from 1979 to 1989. In 1992, he moved to the Illinois Institute of Technology, where he chose to teach freshman physics. He retired in 2011. With a career that spanned more than 60 years, Lederman, who passed away last year, became one of the most important figures in the history of particle physics. He was responsible for several breakthrough discoveries, uncovering new particles that elevated our understanding of the fundamental universe. His Nobel Prize was awarded in 1988 for discovery of the muon neutrino. But perhaps his most critical achievements were his influence on the field of physics and his efforts to improve science education. In later years, Lederman continued his outreach efforts, often in memorable ways. Sometimes, he would even set up shop on the streets of New York City and Chicago, and answer science questions from passersby.

Through his research, Lederman set the stage for Fermilab’s past and future success. The international Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility/Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, hosted by Fermilab, is an international flagship science project to unlock the mysteries of neutrinos. By studying neutrinos, particles at the heart of Dr. Lederman’s work, scientists at Fermilab and across the world will paint a clearer picture of the universe and how it works. This will be the largest science experiment ever hosted on U.S. soil.

During this celebration of Dr. Lederman’s legacy, expect a variety of physics-themed discussions and events, including a Physics Slam and an Ask-a-Physicist panel!

A Physics Slam is a fun competition that pairs a student from the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy (co-founded by Dr. Lederman) with a Fermilab scientist. Expect a no-holds-barred, light-hearted competition. Who will the audience choose as the winner?

In the spirit of his outreach efforts, the program also will have an Ask-a-Physicist panel. A team of scientists will take questions from the audience, in the same informal style of Dr. Lederman taking questions from people in Chicago and New York City",Video,,,"09/25/2019 04:01:52 PM"," "," ",,1,,646,403,166,132,45,33,0,0,35,27,103,63,17,28,0,0,0,646,0,166,0,45,0,0,0.9579,0,0.0105,0.0211,0.0211,0,0.0105,0.0105,0,0,0,0,0.0105,0,0,0.0211,0.0105,0.0211,0.0211,0.0105,0,0.0105,0.0105,0.0105,0,0,0.0105,0.0105,0,0.0105,0,0,0.0105,0.0105,0,0,0.0211,0,0,0.0105,0,0.9508,0,0,0.0164,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0164,0,0,0,0.0164,0.0164,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.9706,0,0.0294,0.0294,0.0588,0,0.0294,0.0294,0,0,0,0,0.0294,0,0,0.0588,0.0294,0.0588,0.0588,0.0294,0,0.0294,0,0.0294,0,0,0,0,0,0.0294,0,0,0.0294,0.0294,0,0,0.0588,0,0,0.0294,0,96,,18,80,,8,,13,3,,13,3
