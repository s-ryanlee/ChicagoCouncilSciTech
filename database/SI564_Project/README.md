SI564 - SQL and Databases Final Project

# Project Requirements

For your final project in this class, you will need to find some data online.  Lots of government organizations provide datasets online, if you'd like to go that route. However, the dataset can be anything you want.  You can even make it up. 

Here are some places you can go to look for data sources:

1. data.gov (Links to an external site.) (over 200,000 data sets on topics including: public safety, health, education, climate)

2. awesome-pubic-datasets repository (Links to an external site.) (many more data sets, including: social networks, sports, museums, machine learning)

3. FiveThirtyEight (Links to an external site.) (a news site that makes article data on politics, sports, science/health, economics, and culture available to the public)

4. Kaggle  (Links to an external site.)(many user-contributed data sets)

 

For the assignment, your normalized data should be at least 4 tables. The entire data set should contain at least 100 rows total. Your data should  have properly defined keys. 

You will create your tables, insert your data, and then write and answer a homework-style assignment for the dataset.  By "homework-style assignment," I mean a letter from the CEO (or similar leader) of Borromean that is requesting the answers to important questions contained within the dataset. You will also answer the questions that you pose of the data in this letter.

What to turn in:

1) Your database documentation, including ERD diagrams.

2) A letter from someone at your fictional company outlining important questions they need answered from the dataset.   This should have at 7-10 questions in it. 

3) The answers to the questions posed in the letter (including your queries to get the result).

4) An outline of why you made the database design choices you made. 

5)  A .sql file containing your exported database.
