The goal of the final project is for you to showcase what you’ve learned in 507 regarding:
- Accessing data via web APIs, including those that require authentication
- Accessing data via scraping
- Accessing data efficiently and responsibly using cachingUsing a database to store and access relational data
- Use basic python data structures and operations to analyze and process data in“interesting” ways
- Use a presentation tool or framework to present data to a user
- Support basic interactivity by allowinga user to choose among different datapresentation options

## Here are a couple of examples that would be reasonable final projects:
- A program that lets a user choose a city and see the average ratings for differentrestaurant types(e.g., bar, breakfast, Indian, Mediterranean) from Google, Yelp,and OpenTable as plotly bar or scatter charts.
- A program that aggregates crime data fromhttps://spotcrime.com/mi/ann+arbor/daily and allows a user to select one ormore crime types to see a graph of crime frequency by month, either for a singleyear comparing across several years.
