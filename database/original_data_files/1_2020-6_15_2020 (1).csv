As the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, understanding viruses and how they function has become essential. The first step of every virus infection is the virus entering a host cell.  How does this happen?  Proteins on the surface of the virus interact with receptors on the surface of a cell to trigger changes in the virus that allow it to penetrate the cell. Using herpesviruses as a model, Dr. Connolly will explain the basics of virus entry and how an understanding of this can help researchers develop antiviral drugs and vaccines.",Video,,,"06/02/2020 02:00:13 PM"," "," ",,1,,1146,1008,324,251,67,50,2,2,56,43,284,40,41,26,1,1,0,1146,0,324,0,67,0,2,0.9667,0.0583,0.0208,0.025,0.0125,0.0042,0.0083,0.0042,0.0042,0.0042,0.0042,0.0042,0.0042,0.0042,0.0083,0.0083,0.0042,0.0042,0.0042,0.0042,0.0042,0.0042,0.0042,0.0042,0.0042,0.0042,0.0042,0.0042,0.0042,0.0042,0.0042,0.0042,0.0042,0.0042,0.0042,0.0083,0.0125,0.0083,0.0083,0.0125,0.0042,0.9817,0.0228,0.0091,0.0091,0.0091,0.0046,0.0091,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0091,0.0137,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.0046,0.8095,0.4286,0.1429,0.1905,0.0476,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0476,0.0476,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0476,0.0476,0.0952,0,41,31,28,27,9,21,6,5,21,6

Gender differences in COVID-19 disease severity have been described in multiple countries, with reports indicating that men often experience more severe disease and greater mortality. Dr. Kovats will summarize available information about the observed gender differences in COVID-19 severity and outline possible social and biological explanations for this gender disparity. One hypothesis is that men and women differ in aspects of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. After a brief primer on the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, Dr. Kovats will review the evidence for sex differences in immune function in humans and animal models and describe how androgens and estrogens modulate immunity. She will explain how COVID-19 patient blood samples might be used to understand the gender differences in immune responses at the molecular and cellular level.",Video,,,"05/20/2020 02:00:10 PM"," "," ",,1,,322,278,144,103,54,38,3,2,49,34,122,22,43,11,3,0,0,322,0,144,0,54,0,3,0.9474,0.0658,0.0263,0,0,0.0132,0.0132,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0132,0,0,0,0,0.0132,0,0,0,0.0263,0.0395,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.9545,0.0606,0.0303,0,0,0.0152,0.0152,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0152,0.0152,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.9,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,0.1,0.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,26,14,19,13,9,3,1,4,3,1

Satchell leads the Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases, a consortium of nine labs at eight schools collaborating on the effort to better understand and devise a means for fighting the continued spread of COVID-19. The team is mapping out the proteins of the virus with the aim of finding a weak spot where medication can intervene and stop the virus from replicating in humans.

KOVAL Distillery is known for creating a line of organic &amp; kosher whiskey, gin, and specialty spirits using unique grains, a signature “heart cut” technique, and only the absolute best quality ingredients. As one of the largest independent and woman-owned craft distilleries in the US, KOVAL is frequently awarded internationally for its bright flavors and eye for design.

As of March 2020, KOVAL has shifted its operations to help provide alcohol-based sanitizer to those on the front lines in the fight against COVID-19. To date, they have donated over 3,000 gallons of sanitizer to Chicagoland first responders and community organizations. Through a virtual tour, get an inside look into how a distillery transitions to produce hand sanitizer and sip along during an optional virtual tasting as Dr. Hart answers questions live.
