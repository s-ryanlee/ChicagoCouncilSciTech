The emergence of antibiotic resistance makes treating infections more difficult. As a result, drug-resistant bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA, pose an increasingly serious threat to human health. Transition metals are critical for all forms of life, with 30% of all proteins and 50% of all enzymes predicted to utilize a metal cofactor. Pathogens must acquire these critical nutrients from the host. As a defense, the immune system renders sites of infection virtually devoid of these critical nutrients in an attempt to starve the invaders. To counter this defense, bacteria utilize numerous strategies to obtain essential metals, including transporters that directly bind the metal and those that rely on microbially produced small molecules. The latter strategy, using metallophores, was thought to be limited to facilitating the acquisition of iron. However, recent studies revealed that S. aureus utilizes a metallophore and its cognate machinery to compete with the host for zinc. Dr. Kehl-Fie will discuss how studying this newly identified system and the struggle for metal during infection informs the development of strategies for treating infection and our understanding of bacteria that inhabit diverse environments.",Video,,,"08/27/2020 02:00:20 PM"," "," ",,1,,320,273,65,58,21,19,1,1,15,14,59,6,17,4,1,0,0,320,0,65,0,21,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0294,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,,14,5,,12,5,5,1,1,5,1

Making the most of the often limited DNA evidence can mean the difference between a stalled and successful investigation. But with these new techniques and arenas being utilized for evidence interpretation, we must also consider: what is at stake if we move too fast to take on the next tantalizing technology?  Lack of transparency, wrongful convictions, misinformation, privacy concerns, bias and more will be discussed.

Have you always wanted to learn about neutrinos? Did you know there is a virtual conference going on with over 3,000 neutrino physicists? The Physics Slam! will be the closing event of the conference. Three attendees will tell the whole world about neutrinos and neutrino research in 10 minutes or less using whatever means they can think of virtually. They will attempt to amaze and educate in hopes of being the Slam! champion. You’ll have a chance to ask any burning questions you might have and vote for your favorite. One of these physicists will walk away as the Neutrino 2020 Slam! Champion.

From the eighth-century The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night to the twentieth-century stories of Jorge Luis Borges, literature has shown us the possibility of other selves, worlds, and even universes. The quantum revolution and recent discoveries in physics and astronomy point to the jaw-dropping idea that our universe may be only one of many universes constituting an infinitely large multiverse. In this talk, Dr. Marcela Carena and Michael Zapata will discuss various theories about parallel universes and how they impact the ways in which we think about science, literature, and our own lives.

The field of ancient DNA began almost forty years ago with advances in biotechnology. Early ancient DNA studies held the promise to answer some of life’s most enduring questions but many of these studies came up short. With hard lessons learned, the practitioners of the young field were on track, identifying genetic compositions of extinct species and contributing to forensic science. In the last decade, advances in biotechnology catapulted the study of ancient DNA into a new and exciting era.

Here, Dr. Ripan Malhi and Dr. Kelsey Witt Dillon will highlight a few of their recent projects that were inconceivable just a few years ago. First, they’ll discuss how they identified recovered DNA from a historic pipe used by an enslaved African on a Maryland plantation, and used it to examine the African ancestry of the pipe’s owner, as well as their living descendants. Second, they’ll show how dog coprolites (fossilized poop) from over 1,000 years ago revealed a surprising amount of detail about the diet and health of ancient dogs and Indigenous peoples who lived in present-day St. Louis.",Video,,,"08/20/2020 02:00:15 PM"," "," ",,1,,397,341,102,88,35,30,1,1,32,27,93,9,31,4,1,0,0,397,0,102,0,35,0,1,1,0.02,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12,,29,11,,23,16,10,2,8,7,2
