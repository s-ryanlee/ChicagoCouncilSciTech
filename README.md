# Connecting Data Sources: Audience Feedback, Social Media, and Web Traffic

Nick Capaldini, Shiyu Guo, Samantha Ryan-Lee

#### Description

This project aimed to understand how the partnered non-profit connects their data sources right now, and create a plan for efficient use in the future. Aspects of effective data use include optimized storage, purposeful collection, and improved analysis.

#### Slide 1

The Chicago Council on Science and Technology (C2ST) blossomed over a decade ago from the success of a series of public talks on climate change and energy funded by grants from NASA.

C2ST partners with local Chicago businesses and venues to host science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) themed events and programs.

#### Slide 2

In July 2020, C2ST partnered with Fermilab and hosted their most popular virtual program, the Neutrino 2020 Physics Slam.

With nearly 350 livestream viewers and almost 1,500 lifetime video views, this program begs the question: **Why is this so popular?** 

Is it the content? 

The presenters? 

The video platform? 

The promotion on their website and social media pages? 

The partnered organization?

C2ST collects data on each of these different variables from a variety of sources, but there’s one problem:

How do they link these sources for a complete understanding of the popularity of their programs?

#### Slide 3

For the Chicago Council on Science and Technology, their STEM programs lie at the center of their data. 

C2ST collects data from Facebook, Youtube, other websites, and sends out surveys to learn more about their audience.

Telling the whole story of how their audience experiences their programs requires C2ST to connect their data from each of these sources.

Connections can be difficult to make, since different sources measure different things.

#### Slide 4

One program might be posted on YouTube under one name, but uses a different name on Facebook.

Facebook data requires a lot of reworking to make sure the data matches correctly with data from other sources.

In order to connect the data across these sources you need a unique code that references each unique program. 

You can think of these identifiers like the barcodes on your favorite cereal box.

Each program has its own unique set of numbers and letters that remains constant throughout each data source.

With these codes, matching a program's Youtube data to its Facebook data is as simple as aligning its ID numbers.

This way, even if the same program has a different name on Facebook and YouTube, C2ST can still connect the two.

#### Slide 5

Making these connections is just the start.

C2ST still needs to rework the data they collect to prepare it for analysis.

We wrote a program that reworks the data for C2ST, which helps streamline the analytic process for them. 

Smoother, more efficient data analysis makes it easier for C2ST to make evidence based decisions that can improve their programs.

There are limitations.

Everything was tailored to C2ST’s data as it currently exists.

Just last week, Facebook announced a change in the way data is reported that made a portion of our work ineffective.

To address this limitation, we documented best practices for data organization and formatting.

This way, C2ST has the foundation to modify the tools using these best practices.

We sought to lay the foundation for C2ST to carry out a plan that maintains relationships between programs and data sources, and streamlines the analytic process.

This helps C2ST with efficient data analysis, leading to data-driven decisions that impact their programs and audiences.
